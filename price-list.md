# Note: 

You can get an extra servo motor as this makes coding much eaiser than the orginal car above, which uses a DC motor for turning and a potentiometer to determine what angle the motor is at.

## Note that Microcontrollers improve rapidly. 

Here is the changing list. The 2021 Portenta should last us a few years.   
(Any of the below materials would work fine, just we will be able to do much more with the latest equipment the Portenta and Vision Shield)

## 2021 Microcontroller Price List   
When we combine the PortentaH7 with the LoRa vision shield we have a great Machine Learning duo. But it is expensive.  


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374580-13deb749-820c-46db-bc04-597c610d2bd0.png" width=400 /> [Arduino PortentaH7](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7)  $103.40 USD  The base best Arduino

The Portenta Might need female headers if you don't want to solder wires directly onto it. Mr. Ellis should be able to provide those. Here is a link if you want them. The male headers are good to attach the Portenta to a breadboard. Note: The female headers are attached to come up out of the board.

## Also to view what you are working on a screen is a good idea

OR the much better 16 levels of Grayscale OLED<br>

I do have a TFT V2 touchscreen but the refresh rate is too slow.

# Optional 2021:

[Charmed Labs Pixy2 Machine Learning Color cam](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/charmed-labs-pixy-21-cmucam5-image-sensor.html) $76.97 CDN   This already has Machine Learning in it and detects different shades, (black and white are not a shade). Can really easily do very complex things, and it is fast.

## 2020 Microcontroller Price List

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374371-e522276f-00ab-47ba-86d2-fe1cc8a5bc37.png" width=400 /> [Arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense-with-headers) $33.40 USD

This board made around 2018 has Machine Learning ability and an accelerometer. A great starting choice for Machine Learning, however it is lacking when using the color camera below since the resolution size can only be 48 x 48 pixels.
