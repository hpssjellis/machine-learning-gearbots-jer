this is a set of 50 for $11.99 USD. We will probably have some at the course.




# Note: 

You must get an extra servo motor as this makes coding much eaiser than the orginal car above, which uses a DC motor for turning and a potentiometer to determine what angle the motor is at.

## Note that Microcontrollers improve rapidly. 

Here is the changing list. 

## 2023-2024 Microcontroller Price List   

IF you have the Portenta with Vision Shield then keep it. It analyses faster, but it is bigger, much more expensive, only grayscale and more fragile as it is much easier to brick than the following.


1. <img src="https://github.com/hpssjellis/machine-learning-gearbots-jer/assets/5605614/3d1a1be9-0d77-4882-9bbc-3a3b6aa90794" width=400 /> [XIAO-Esp32S3-sense](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/)  XIAO-Esp32S3-sense from seedstudio only $13.99 USD

Even past students may want to get the new equipment as it is so cheap compared to the PortentaH7

------------------------------------------- Nothing below this line is needed for 2023-2024 -------------------------------------------------------------

## 2021 Microcontroller Price List   
When we combine the PortentaH7 with the LoRa vision shield we have a great Machine Learning duo. But it is expensive.  


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374580-13deb749-820c-46db-bc04-597c610d2bd0.png" width=400 /> [Arduino PortentaH7](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/portenta-h7)  $103.40 USD  The base MCU and best Arduino


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374592-36bb6dfd-ec10-4796-b998-782b58ce8730.png" width=400 /> [Arduino LoRa Vision Shield](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-portenta-vision-shield-lora%C2%AE) $63.25 USD  Allows the Portenta to See and hear and use the LoRaWan networks


The Portenta Might need female headers if you don't want to solder wires directly onto it. Mr. Ellis should be able to provide those. Here is a link if you want them. The male headers are good to attach the Portenta to a breadboard. Note: The female headers are attached to come up out of the board.

## Also to view what you are working on a screen is a good idea

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133946385-f768bd3b-60fd-44ec-92c6-80e3bbd6cf6d.png" width=100 /> [Seeedstudio Grove 128x64 MonoChrome "black or white" OLED Display](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/seeedstudio-grove-128x64-oled-display.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwv5uKBhD6ARIsAGv9a-yFXp7cpk2qEBbJ-mKO3dtvo5_8n0M5hqiUZE1wPE7RPDKo6fMhjfsaApVREALw_wcB)  $19.10 CDN   Needed to see what the Portenta sees <br>

OR the much better 16 levels of Grayscale OLED<br>

I do have a TFT V2 touchscreen but the refresh rate is too slow.

Note: If you didn't get the 3 wire servo for turning then you need this:


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374173-5b7151d8-e30d-4162-8eb1-fb6f80b20638.png" width=400 />
 If you don't get the 3 wire servo you need this 
 DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Carrier  https://www.pololu.com/product/2135      from Pololu $9.95 USD

 As a group we decided not to use this method as the coding was much more confusing and turning was unreliable and slow.


 Note: A few of the advanced students are working with RF modules and receivers, but this is only for students who know what they are doing. Any student at the course can find out more about this process.

# Optional 2021:  



<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5605614/133374299-bcad6533-8d8f-48f3-a833-85228e8ff984.png" width=200 /> 
[Charmed Labs Pixy2 Machine Learning Color cam](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/charmed-labs-pixy-21-cmucam5-image-sensor.html) $76.97 CDN   This already has Machine Learning in it and detects different shades, (black and white are not a shade). Can really easily do very complex things, and it is fast.

## 2020 Microcontroller Price List

This board made around 2018 has Machine Learning ability and an accelerometer. A great starting choice for Machine Learning, however it is lacking when using the color camera below since the resolution size can only be 48 x 48 pixels.
